# React Context API Exploration

This project is designed to demonstrate the practical usage and benefits of React's Context API in a modern web application. Built with React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS, this application serves as a functional showcase of managing global state in a React application without the need for external state management libraries.

## Project Overview

The core idea of this application is to provide a simple yet effective user interface to interact with a global state managed by React's Context API. It explores various patterns and best practices for state management in React, ensuring components receive updates efficiently and maintain synchronization with the application state.

## Features

- **Global State Management**: Utilizes React's Context API to handle and share global state across different components.
- **Dynamic Theme Switching**: Demonstrates dynamic theming capabilities using Context to switch between themes.
- **User Preferences**: Stores and retrieves user preferences (like theme choice) across sessions using the Context API combined with local storage.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs without leaving your HTML.
- **Context API**: React's own solution for managing global state without props drilling.
